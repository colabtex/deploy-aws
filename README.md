# deploy-aws

*** This was HARD. The purpose of this repo was for Wei Hao's CIT 438. I started off working on this on the schools VM, but it only made things harder. Eventually I switched to my own VM (which itself took some time to set up)

First, follow steps in os-setup-steps.txt

Second, follow steps in git-setup-steps.txt

Then, check to be sure everything is configured properly

Finally, run start.sh so that the following is accomplished
  1. Display the previous steps you took manually (not they need to be completed again)
  2. Run the scripts needed to finalize your configuration
  3. Initiate the main AWS deployment script (currently unnamed)
  
 After all of those steps a basic AWS example project should be complete
 
 At that point, verify everything is set up as desired, and make changes as necessary

*** Note: though the AWSkeys have been included in the files, I disabled the user just before making this repo public

There are still issues with this code, but I made some mistake somewhere and now I'm much further than I was a couple hours ago,
the best that could be done was to at least get the script in an order where it will somewhat compile
